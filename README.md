How does this work?
-------------------
This ain't meant to be used by anybody yet.  If you _really_ want to try it...

1. Copy `wishlist.default.config.js` to `wishlist.config.js` and fill out your API key.
2. Run `npm run build-cache` to cache weapons and perks.
3. Modify the wishlists in the data directory.
3. Run `npm run build` to actually generate wishlists based on wishlist data.

Notes
-----
The format of DIM wishlists can be found [here][1].
